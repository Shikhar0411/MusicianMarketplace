# MusicianMarketplace
Marketplace for Bands
There are multiple ideas for this project
1 - Create a marketplace
This marketplace is for restaurants and bands to come together, offer gigs and just be seen by as many folks as possible
2 - Community of musicians
This is a social platform wherein people can come together, form groups, practice music, get gigs. Basically a freelance platform 
of multiple music artists to come together.
3 - Production and marketing
Small Indi bands requiring exposure on social media or in publicity in general, this platform can provide production teams to these small scale
bands
